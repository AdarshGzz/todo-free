# **App Name**: FocusFlow

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Task Generation: Suggests related tasks based on the user's input using AI; uses a LLM as a planning tool.
- Drag-and-Drop Task Management: Provides a drag-and-drop interface to rearrange the user's tasks across all available views (Inbox, Today, Projects, Pages, Calendar), complete with fluid and appealing animations.
- Multi-Page Task Management: Creates and manages multiple pages for tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Travel). Each page is an independent to-do list, with smooth navigation between pages.
- Streamlined Input: Designed for zero-friction task capture. User input will be parsed and categorized via keyboard-first input and natural language.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#D92B2B) to evoke boldness, professionalism, and energy. Avoids cliches.
- Background color: Desaturated red (#262323) providing a near-black slate backdrop with subtle hints of the primary hue to avoid harshness, appropriate for a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Analogous saturated orange (#D98A2B) to draw focus and contrast, approximately 30 degrees to the left of the primary color on the color wheel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), best for titles and other short runs of text. Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif).
- Subtle transitions and spring-based animations used for task creation, completion, reordering, and expansions to create fluid micro-interactions.
- A three-pane adaptive layout (Nav · List · Details) which is collapsible on smaller screens.
